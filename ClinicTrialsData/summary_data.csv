a study of belantamab mafodotin monotherapy in multiple myeloma participants with normal and varying degree of impaired renal function,209626,"belantamab mafodotin is an antibody-drug conjugate (adc) containing humanized anti- b-cell maturation antigen (bcma) monoclonal antibody (mab). renal impairment is a major complication of multiple myeloma (mm) and the majority of mm participants is either at risk or already has renal dysfunction at initial diagnosis. the purpose of this study is to assess the pharmacokinetics (pk), safety, and tolerability of belantamab mafodotin monotherapy in participants with rrmm, who have had at least 3 lines of prior treatment (or at least 2 lines of prior treatment if ineligible for autologous stem cell transplantation ) and have either normal or impaired renal functions. the study will consist of two parts: part 1 will include participants with normal or mildly impaired renal function and severe renal impairment and part 2 will include participants with end-stage renal disease (esrd), where participants are either not undergoing or require hemodialysis. participants will be administered belantamab mafodotin at a dose of 2.5 milligram per kilogram (mg or kg) intravenously once in three weeks (q3w) dosing in part 1. based on the part 1 safety or pharmacokinetic (pk) data, part 2 participants will be administered the dose of either 2.5 mg or kg or 1.9 mg or kg (or other adjusted dose). participants will be treated with belantamab mafodotin monotherapy until confirmed disease progression, death, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or end of study, whichever occurs first. this study will include a screening phase, treatment phase, follow-up phase and a post analysis continued treatment (pact) phase . the total duration of the study is approximately up to 48 months.","This clinical trial aims to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of belantamab mafodotin, an antibody-drug conjugate, in participants with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have undergone several lines of prior treatment. The study will be conducted in two parts: one for participants with normal or mildly impaired renal function and severe renal impairment, and the other for participants with end-stage renal disease. Participants will receive belantamab mafodotin intravenously every three weeks. The study will continue until disease progression, death, unacceptable toxicity, consent withdrawal, or study completion, with a total duration of up to 48 months."
intravenous amino acid therapy for kidney protection in cardiac surgery.,PROTection/47/OSR,"to date, no pharmacological agents are proven efficacious in treating perioperative aki. there is a strong biological rationale for the administration of amino acid in the management of patients at risk of aki with increases in renal blood flow and gfr of 25 to 60 for several hours after the administration of amino acids (woods ll 1993) mediated by a afferent arteriolar dilation.(meyer tw 1983) moreover, animal models have demonstrated that an increase in renal blood flow in response to a short-term amino acid infusion can protect the kidney from acute ischemic insults. finally, these nephro-protective effects are preserved in critical illness. cardiac surgery appears to be the best setting to test the likely beneficial renal effects of amino acid because of pathophysiological principles and the ability to intervene before the injury has begun. although the etiology of aki in cardiac surgery is multifactorial, renal hypoperfusion is believed to play a major role in this development by decreasing renal perfusion through a reduction in renal blood flow and through the activation of the sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin system with afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction. in this setting, a global increase in renal blood flow by means of amino acid therapy appears a logical and promising intervention. the primary aim of the study is to determine whether providing continuous infusion of a balanced mixture of amino acids, compared to placebo (balanced crystalloid solution), reduces the incidence of acute kidney injury (aki) in patients scheduled for cardiac surgery defined as kdigo stage 1 or greater during hospital stay.","This clinical trial aims to investigate the effectiveness of continuous infusion of a balanced mixture of amino acids in reducing the incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Previous evidence suggests that amino acid administration can increase renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate, offering potential nephro-protective effects. The study is motivated by the belief that renal hypoperfusion plays a significant role in the development of AKI during cardiac surgery. The primary outcome of the trial is to determine if amino acid therapy can decrease the occurrence of AKI defined as KDIGO stage 1 or greater post-surgery compared to a placebo (balanced crystalloid solution)."
blood pressure control in acute ischemic stroke,NUSingapore_Vijay,"management of acutely elevated blood pressure during the early phase of ischemic stroke remains controversial. in patients treated with iv-tpa, the risk of ich is closely related to the bp levels. however, intensive reduction of bp carries a theoretical risk of clinical deterioration by inducing cerebral hypoperfusion. assessment of cerebral perfusion before and after bp reduction is one of the most scientific method to evaluate the safety (and potential benefits) of bp management in the acute phase of stroke. this project will impact practices and delivery of bp management during the acute phase of ischemic stroke. the findings would aid in designing phase 3 clinical trials will track clinical indicators, including the impact on functional outcomes as well as quality-of-life and cost-effectiveness.","This clinical trial aims to address the controversy surrounding the management of acutely elevated blood pressure in patients with ischemic stroke, particularly those treated with IV-tPA. The study will focus on assessing cerebral perfusion before and after blood pressure reduction to evaluate the safety and potential benefits of blood pressure management in the acute phase of stroke. The findings from this project have the potential to impact clinical practices by informing the design of larger phase 3 clinical trials. These trials will track clinical indicators, such as functional outcomes, quality of life, and cost-effectiveness, to further understand the effects of blood pressure management during the early phase of ischemic stroke."
rct meropenem vs piperacillin-tazobactam for definitive treatment of bsi's due to ceftriaxone non-susceptible escherichia coli and klebsiella spp.,ACTRN12613000532707,"no randomized controlled trials (rcts) have yet been performed comparing different treatment options for ampc or esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae. during the last 10 years we have seen an exponentially increasing rate of carbapenem resistance worldwide, including australia and new zealand. the investigators urgently need data from well-designed rcts to guide clinicians in the treatment of antibiotic resistant gram-negative infections. the investigators face a situation where a commonly used antibiotic for these infections (meropenem) may be driving carbapenem resistance. for this reason, the investigators are seeking to compare a carbapenem-sparing regimen with a carbapenem for the treatment of these infections. formal evaluation of safety and efficacy of generic antibiotics in the treatment of infection is of immense clinical and public health importance, and no formal trial has yet been conducted to address these issues. the international collaboration between teams of clinician researchers, some of whom are leaders in their field, makes it highly likely that the outcomes of this trial will have a significant impact on clinical practice. the investigators hypothesis is that piperacillin or tazobactam (a carbapenem-sparing regimen) is non-inferior to meropenem (a widely used carbapenem) for the definitive treatment of bloodstream infections due to third-generation cephalosporin non-susceptible e. coli or klebsiella species.","This clinical trial aims to address the lack of randomized controlled trials comparing treatment options for infections caused by antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacteria, specifically AmpC or ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae. The increasing global rate of carbapenem resistance has led to the urgent need for data to guide clinicians in treating these infections. The investigators plan to compare a carbapenem-sparing regimen with the commonly used antibiotic meropenem to determine safety and efficacy in treating these infections. The study involves an international collaboration of clinician researchers and aims to demonstrate that piperacillin or tazobactam is non-inferior to meropenem for treating bloodstream infections caused by certain bacteria."
